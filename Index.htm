			<h1> Welcome to Color NE-Thing</h1>
			
			
			<h3> Objective</h3>
			<p>&nbsp A coloring book phone app that allows you to color any picture 
			you want. There's not an app that allows the user to choose any 
			selection of picture and color it. Also, the app will allow you to 
			take a picture and render that picture to coloring book format and 
			color it how you want. There are other coloring book apps, but they 
			only allow the user to choose from a group of provided pictures or a 
			specific genre. Our solution is better than what is out because no
			 app allows a user to take a picture and then render it on spot to 
			 color. Our solution also lets the user choose from multiple types 
			 of pictures to choose from</p>
			 <h3> Proposed Milestones </h3>
			<p>&nbsp We had several steps to complete our milestones. First, is to get the
			 picture outline rendering working efficiently, and then incorporating
			  the search bar to find pictures. Lastly, linking the app to the camera 
				and photo album to use pictures the user has stored on their phone or 
				will currently take.</p>		
			<h3>Testing</h3>
			<p>&nbsp For our testing we let a group of children play with our app. They are
			8, 10,and 13 years old. They confirmed it was simple and fun. Although depending
			on the age we found that it was harder for young children to find pictures on 
			the web. Their mother, on the side, while the children were playing cursed us because
			now her children were going to be asking to play with her phones.
